# xData
This is the very first challenge to complete for the xData team in the Summer of 2018.

In the folder called Results you will find the results after counting the number of beans placed on a white sheet of paper. 
After following my developed algorithm, the closest number to the actual result was 32 beans, found in "ResultsBeans2.xls".

Inside the folder "Gifs" you will 2 animated gifs for the 4 pictures with various lighting of the 50 beans. In order to complete this, I stacked a total of 12 images repeating each image 3 times, only to smooth the transition within the animation. 

Within "Montages" you will see 2 collages: one on a straight line with 12 images, and another in the form of a square. These were created shortly after the stacking to create the animated gifs. 

Lastly, you can find my scripts to first count the number of beans, create the animated gifs and montages. Please note that in order to have this perform smoothly, one must open 3 copies of each image within the folder "Beans" in ImageJ. 

The diagram can be found inside the folder "Diagram", and original images inside the folder titled "Beans".
